# OnelapAutoHotkeys
This is an AutoHotkeys script to automate mouse clicks in Onelap on a PC

It depends on AutoHotkey and requires that to be installed: https://www.autohotkey.com/

The script is extensively commented so that anyone will know exactly what does what. You can open it in Notepad to see the script.

Drag or copy the script to your startup folder (type win key and r, then type and run shell:startup to get to your Startup folder)

This script enables the following commands on a 1920x1080 screen:

Win Shift o together - launches Onelap
Control o - bring focus back to the Onelap window
Control shift o together - minimises OBS
s - skips an interval

y - agree to a rpompt (y for yes)
n - cancel or disagree with a prompt (n for No)
m - bring up the menu
p - click the power tab in the menu to see your stats (will only work if you have pressed m beforehand
Shift and p together - will go straight to the power stats and then close after 10 seconds
e - ends the ride, but only if you have pressed m for menu beforehand. You will need to accept the next dialogue box by pressing y (or n if you decide not to quit)
